# ðŸ”¥ Firewall Updater

**Firewall Updater** is a lightweight Python utility, packaged as a Docker image, designed to **automatically update your cloud firewall ingress rules with your machineâ€™s current public IP address** â€” so you never get locked out of your infrastructure again.

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters (The BEST Reason)

Dynamic IP addresses are the bane of secure remote access. If your IP changes unexpectedly, your firewall rules block your access â€” causing downtime, frustration, and wasted time. This tool transforms your firewall into a *dynamic, self-healing gatekeeper* that adapts instantly whenever your IP changes.

For sysadmins and DevOps engineers, this means:
- **Zero downtime** caused by IP mismatches
- Seamless remote management without emergency VPN setups
- Confidence that your critical servers remain accessible and secure

In short: itâ€™s your *reliability insurance* for remote access.

## ðŸ›  How It Works (Inside Docker)

1. The Docker container boots a minimal Python environment with all dependencies.
2. On each run, the script:
   - Reads OCI API credentials from a mounted config volume.
   - Retrieves the current public IP from a trusted external service.
   - Updates the OCI Security List ingress rule accordingly.
3. The container exits immediately, designed for scheduled or on-demand runs.
